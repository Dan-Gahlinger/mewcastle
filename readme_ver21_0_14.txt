The New Castle V21.0.14 - Released Oct 15/2022

The LINUX version of the new castle v21.0.14 is also included, it is the same code as the DOS/Windows version, may have many bugs!
please report errors.  The debugging mode has been left intact in order to facility this...


simply unzip to any place you like, it will create its own directory. and read the castle_user_guide files (DOC or PDF) for information
for the linux version - decompressing the file downloaded with create a directory like ~/newcastle, then simply cd ~/newcastle
then run the Linux version of the game supplied: newcast (eg: ./newcast) to run it
For Linux users there are several choices on which image to download - there is a .tar.gz which works as usual,
and there is a .zip version which will uncompress making the directory needed as above
there is also a .tar.xz for those who prefer a smaller archive, xz is fantastic - the absolute best compression around. works same as the .tar.gz
The Linux version needs read/write access to its own files as save games and such create new files or update as you'd expect they'd need to...

The MAC Version has been ressurected! Finally I've been able to build the Mac binary. Unpacking and playing the Mac version is identical to the Linux version above
Except the Mac binary is called: newcastle_mac
it'll decompress creating a newcastle directory and putting eveyrthing you need in there, then just change to that dir
and type: ./newcastle_mac

Note: For PC Dos/Windows there are several versions available - use the one that suits your preference...
there is an EXE installer (with built-in uninstaller) - and also this version as a ZIP file and as a RAR - pick the one you like
then there are two "plain" versions - as RAR or as ZIP - again pick your preference.
The plain versions uncompress and create a "newcastle" directory with everything in it but have no desktop shortcut or uninstaller.

Note: I am very close to getting the Raspberry Pi (Arm) version of Castle completed and it'll be posted when ready
